# gill examples - tokens

Gill is aimed at abstracting away many of the complexities and boilerplate
required to perform common interactions with the Solana blockchain, while still
offering the low level "escape hatches" when developers need (or want)
fine-grain control.

Take a look through these examples to see how gill works and even
[how it compares](../get-started/README.md#comparison-of-gill-vs-solanakit-aka-web3js-v2) to
using the vanilla web3js v2 library.

## Tech stack used

- TypeScript and NodeJS
- Package manger: `pnpm`
- Running the scripts: `esrun`

## Setup locally

1. Clone this repo to your local system
2. Install the packages via `pnpm  install`
3. Change into this directory: `cd examples/tokens`

### Running the included scripts with esrun

Once setup locally, you will be able to run the scripts included within this
repo using `esrun`:

```shell
npx esrun ./src/<script>
pnpx esrun ./src/<script>
```

> From the [esrun](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esrun) readme:
>
> esrun is a "work out of the box" library to execute Typescript (as well as
> modern Javascript with decorators and stuff) without having to use a bundler.
> This is useful for quick demonstrations or when launching your tests written
> in Typescript.
