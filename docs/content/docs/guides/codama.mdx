title: Generate Solana program clients with Codama
description:
  "Step-by-step guide on how to use Codama to generate a Solana program client from an IDL."
---

[Codama](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama) is a tool that allows developers to take a Solana
program's IDL and generate client libraries (e.g. JavaScript, Rust, etc) for use by other
applications. Codama handles all the complexities of crafting Solana instructions into an IDL, a
config file, and importing a function.

Codama is quickly becoming part of the defacto standard tooling for Solana developers. Even the new
Solana Program Library (SPL) program clients are now generated using Codama. See the
[solana-program](https://github.com/solana-program) organization on GitHub.

This guide will walk you through the step-by-step of taking a Solana program IDL and generating a
JavaScript/TypeScript client library that utilizes the `gill` library. Afterwards, you can import
the various functions, types, and more into your application and easily interact with the specific
Solana program your IDL is from.

<Callout>
  This guide was written using `v1.1.1` of the Codama CLI. If you experience any issues or
  discrepancies on newer versions, please [open an
  issue](https://github.com/gillsdk/gill/issues/new?title=%5BCodama%5D%20) on the gill repo here so
  we can investigate and update this guide.
</Callout>

<Steps>
<Step>

## Install the Codama CLI

To get started, you first need to install the
[Codama CLI](https://github.com/codama-idl/codama/tree/main/packages/cli) inside your repo:

```package-install
@codama/cli
```

<Callout type="warn">
  The Codama CLI is **not** meant to be installed globally, but rather version controlled with your
  repo. Ensuring your generated program client will continue to be compatible with the rest of your
  code base (should breaking changes happen in the future).
</Callout>

This will allow you to execute the Codama CLI via your package manager's "run" command:

```shell
npx codama --version
# output: 1.1.1
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Create a Codama config

The Codama CLI utilizes a config file to declare which "renderers" should be used and other assorted
logic. Gill provides the `createCodamaConfig()` helper function to simplify this setup.

<Callout>
  Utilizing a JavaScript Codama config file (e.g. `codama.js`) is recommended for use with gill. If
  you need more control, you can always fallback to [manually initializing your Codama
  config](#manually-initialize-a-codama-config) using a JSON file.
</Callout>

Create a `codama.js` file to utilize the `createCodamaConfig()` function, providing your program
specific configuration:

```ts
import { createCodamaConfig } from "gill";

export default createCodamaConfig({
  idl: "program/idl.json",
  clientJs: "clients/js/src/generated",
});
```

- `idl` - should be the relative path to your program's IDL JSON file
- `clientJs` - should be the relative path to where your generated program client should be stored
  within your repo

<Callout>
  It's recommended to store your generated program client in a `generated` directory. This will
  allow you to easily co-locate other manually crafted functions. See [this
  example](https://github.com/solana-program/token-2022/tree/main/clients/js/src) of the SPL Token
  Extension program client doing exactly this.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

## Generate your program client with Codama

With your Codama config file setup, you can use the `run` command to generate your
JavaScript/TypeScript client, storing the generated output in your configured destination:

```shell
npx codama run js
```

You can now import your newly generated client library from anywhere in your code base or publish as
an installable package for any application to easily consume and interact with your program.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Multiple program clients in a single repo

At the time of writing this guide, the latest Codama CLI (`v1.1.1`) does not support multiple
program clients in a single Codama config file.

If you have multiple Solana program IDLs in a single repo, you will need to create a separate config
file for each. We recommend creating a shell script to generate all the program clients with a
single command.

For example, the gill library itself utilizes a shell script similar to this one:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# generate all the codama clients (per their respective config files)
npx codama run js --config ./idls/token_metadata/codama.js
npx codama run js --config ./idls/another_program/codama.js

# run the repo's prettier settings on the generated files
npx prettier --write './packages/gill/src/programs/**/generated/{*,**/*}.{ts,js}'
```

This script will execute the `codama run js` command for each program by explicitly passing in the
config file to each. Then you can easily execute any additional commands you desire, like performing
your standard prettier formatting operations.

<Callout title="Use gill's source code as a reference">
  You can find the [exact shell
  script](https://github.com/gillsdk/gill/blob/master/idls/build-codama-clients.sh) that gill uses
  in our repo to ship some of the program clients gill includes.
</Callout>

## Manually initialize a Codama config

For more complex scenarios, you may desire to have more control over the Codama config file. In this
case, use the `codama.json` file and manually configure it to your needs.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Create a codama.json file

Run the Codama `init` command and follow the prompts to scaffold your `codama.json` config file:

```shell
npx codama init
```

You will be asked a few questions in order to generate the config file for your IDL:

- location of the IDL within your repo (e.g. `program/idl.json`)
- the type of clients to generate (make sure to select "JavaScript client")
- where your generated JavaScript client should be output to (e.g. `clients/js/src/generated`)

<Callout>
  It's recommended to store your generated program client in a `generated` directory. This will
  allow you to easily co-locate other manually crafted functions. See [this
  example](https://github.com/solana-program/token-2022/tree/main/clients/js/src) of the SPL Token
  Extension program client doing exactly this.
</Callout>

Your newly created `codama.json` config file should look something like this:

```json
{
  "idl": "program/idl.json",
  "before": [],
  "scripts": {
    "js": {
      "from": "@codama/renderers-js",
      "args": ["clients/js/src/generated"]
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout>
  At the time of writing this guide, the latest Codama CLI version of `v1.1.1` does not support
  multiple program clients in a single `codama.json` config file. You will have to create a separate
  config file for each Solana program. See [Multiple program clients in a single
  repo](#multiple-program-clients-in-a-single-repo) for more info.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step>

### Replace @solana/kit imports with gill

By default, Codama will utilize the `@solana/kit` package for the imported symbols within the
generated client. Since the gill library includes Kit (so you do not have to manually install it),
we need to instruct Codama to utilize `gill` instead.

Update your `codama.json` config file to include the following `dependencyMap` settings by passing
the following object as the **second value** of the JavaScript renderer's `args` array:

```json
{
  "idl": "program/idl.json",
  "before": [],
  "scripts": {
    "js": {
      "from": "@codama/renderers-js",
      "args": [
        "clients/js/src/generated",
        {
          "dependencyMap": {
            "solanaAccounts": "gill",
            "solanaAddresses": "gill",
            "solanaCodecsCore": "gill",
            "solanaCodecsDataStructures": "gill",
            "solanaCodecsNumbers": "gill",
            "solanaCodecsStrings": "gill",
            "solanaErrors": "gill",
            "solanaInstructions": "gill",
            "solanaOptions": "gill",
            "solanaPrograms": "gill",
            "solanaRpcTypes": "gill",
            "solanaSigners": "gill"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
